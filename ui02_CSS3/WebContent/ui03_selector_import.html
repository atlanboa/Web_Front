	<p>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
		printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
		standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
		a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
		survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
		typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
		the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
		passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
		Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
	<p>Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
		is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
		literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
		McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
		looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
		Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
		classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
		comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
		Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
		This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
		the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
		amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
		Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
		interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
		Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
		accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
		Rackham.</p>
